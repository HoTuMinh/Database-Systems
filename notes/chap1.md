# CHAPTER 1: DATABASES AND DATABASE USERS 

- everyday we interact with databases (i.e making a transaction, purchase something online,...) $\rightarrow$ **traditional database applications** (most of the information stored and accessed is either textual or numeric)
- nowadays we have **multimedia databases** (can store images, audio clips, video streams digitally)
- **Geographic information systems (GIS)** (maps, weather, satelite images,...)
- **Data Warehouse** and **online analytical processing (OLAP)** systems are used to extract and analyze information from large databases
- **Real-time** and **active database technology** is used to control industrial manufacaturing processes

| TERMS                             | DEFINITIONS                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| database                          | collection of related data
| data                              | facts that can be recorded and have meaning                                                                                  |
| database management system (DBMS) | collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database  (defining, constructing, manipulating, sharing) |
| defining a database               | specifying the data types, structure, constraints of the data                                                                |
| meta-data                         | database definition, stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog                                                    |
| constructing a database           | the process of storing the data on some storage that is controlled by the DBMS                                               |
| manipulating the database         | functions to retrieve data, update the database, generate reports from the data                                              |
| sharing a database                | allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously                                                     |
| query                             | causes some data to be retrieved                                                                                             |
| transaction                       | cause some data to be read                                                                                                   |
| protection                        | includes system protection (against crashes) & security protection (against malicious access)                                |
| maintain a database               | allow the system to evolve as requirements change overtime                                                                   |

- a database has the following implicit properties
  - it represents some aspect of the real world (called **miniworld** or **universe of discourse (UoD)**)
  - it's a logical coherent collection of data
  - it's designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose
- an **application programs** accesses the database by sending requests or queries for data to the DBMS

### An Example: University database

- **_Defining the database_**: specify the different types of **data elements** to be stored in each record
